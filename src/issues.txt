would there be a problem if the reactor unit was changed in its view? This would cause this calculated average to be off

CURRENT: totalTemp is returning a promise and not a number. Mayybe push to array and then sum it all once the promise resolves?
or check if it's the corect value appended to the end of string (22.22222)
-await the final average calculation expression and itll work?

-need to add reactor avg temp graph
-improve "loading" while reactor cards are loading
-remove commented, unnecessary code
-yeah probably split up so you don't have to refresh the whole component
-responsive design
-use lato font 

-CURRENT next: consider moving styles from cards to stylesheet for responsivity or else changing the component used
